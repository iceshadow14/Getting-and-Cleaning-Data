# Code Book
This code book modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables 
and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

## Variables
* data.train.x, data.train.y, data.train.subject, data.test.x, data.test.y, and data.test.subject contain the data from the downloaded files.
* data.x, data.y and data.subject merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
* data.extract.x is the extract of mean and standard deviation for each measurement which names in features.mean.std
* A similar approach is taken with activity names through the data.activity.labels variable
* data merges data.subject, data.y.named and data.extract.x in a big dataset.
* Finally, data.averages contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a .txt file. ddply() from the plyr package is used to apply colMeans() and ease the development.

## Identifiers
subject - The ID of the test subject
activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
